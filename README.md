My ZSH 'e4czmod' Configuration
===============================

Date: 20201012

This is heavily borrowed from "Prezto - Instantly Awesome Zsh" and trimmed down
to meet my requirements. I want to know what I am using and have a blazing fast
response on the shell environment. This is not finished yet and so my README.md
is quite incomplete. Regardles, lots of fixes are needed, but it works without
severe errors (I hope).

I had been using macOS and now it is out of service. Repairing in Argentina is
hard, so I switched to Manjaro on my good old Thinkpad T430s.
